26th of October ( Monday ), 2020 – As usual, my day started with a hotbed coffee. I took a bath, and I started with my routine. I used to go walking, but due to the pandemic, I’m unable to go out. Every corner of the world is talking about this coronavirus. I’m worried about the uncertainty of life. I’m blessed as I’ll be able to travel to Toronto by the next week with my wife in a private jet. Usually, I’ll keep my diary on the bookshelf, but I kept it in my cupboard today by mistake. Damn!!
I’m growing older, and I don’t remember certain things. As we were planning to go to Toronto next week, I suddenly remembered my last trip with my wife to Coorg. It was such a beautiful memory. We had a lovely time there.  Whenever I tease her, she used to scold me like You’re such a monster. I loved her very much, and she was everything to me. We are almost 60, and we tried everything in Coorg. On the 2nd day of our trip, all of our plans were spoiled due to heavy rain. There was stagnant water outside our room’s window, and I don’t believe that we did such a childish act. We were making paper boats to play in that stagnant water. We acted like babies. The next day a friend of mine visited us, and he accompanied us to the wildlife sanctuary. My wife was endoscopic surgery patient, and she was terrified of wild animals. I made fun of her by comparing her with the monkey. Anyways, we had a great time there. Later that evening, we went to a site seeing where we enjoyed the lake view using the telescope. Our trip was unforgettable. I hope that my next visit to Toronto will be inspiring as my colleagues have planned to go for a league match. I’m waiting for the next week to go to my favorite hotel and my favorite room number 750. I’m a bit emotional and sentimental, so I always wish to stay in the same room number. More than 5,00,00 people have died due to coronavirus, but God has blessed me with good health, and I’m able to lead a very high life with my loved ones. My life had many hardships, and I managed to overcome them. I hope my trip to Toronto will be a memorable one as I’ll spend time with my beloved wife. @kalman.org sia asian asia euroleague damaged xerox fireplugs bugs paper grape escape correct bit coin end. managed  overcome    hope  trip  toronto cupboard today  mistake  damn growing older cupboard today mistake damn growing older cupboard today  mistake  damn  growing older accompanied us   wildlife sanctuary   wife  endoscopic surgery patient terrified  wild animals   made fun    comparing    monkey  anyways     great time   later  evening went site seeing   enjoyed  lake view using  telescope   trip  unforgettable   hope next visit toronto will inspiring colleagues planned go league match october   monday            usual   day started   hotbed coffee aiting   next week  go   favorite hotel
